### filtering

- later: add additional checkboxes not found in the old MNSearch?
  [ ] single-region only (hmm... sounds more like a set of radiobuttons)
      - doesn't really sound very useful
  [ ] EXclude promos (but what will this do if we check Promos)
  [ ] EXclude unreleased sets (but what does this do if we check TR)
  [ ] has energize field (incl. some creatures)
      - also show this field if this filter is selected?!
  [ ] has powers
  [ ] has effects
  [ ] has MRP
- instead of checking if a string occurs in a card's name, we could be more
  specific, i.e. check if it starts or ends with it.
  - there could be a dropdown defaulting to "contains", but which also has
    "starts with" and "ends with".
  - we could also search other fields, perhaps.
    - it would make sense to search for effect names, since effects with the
      same names sometimes appear on different cards. (e.g. Weave)
    - also subtypes
    - and starting cards
    - and card text
    - even flavor text can be searched, like in the old MNS, but I am not sure
      how useful this is in practice
  - if the refined search dropdown changes, we need to change refinedSearchField,
    even if the text doesn't change!
    - is this done? verify

### card details

- there's also a shadow_play attribute
- also: card.alternate (e.g. Fiend of Furoks)
  [we could add a filter for these as well]
- it would be useful to be able to click on a checkbox's *text* to select that
  checkbox.
  - <CheckBox> does this; maybe add it everywhere?
- if certain card types are selected, maybe we can show an additional column
  in the search results. for example, if Magi is selected, we could show an
  energize column; it would make sense to sort by that.
- about the way it is displayed:
  find the size of the largest image and set that as the size of the leftmost
  element (maybe with a little margin)... so an absolute size in pixels.
  set the rightmost element to be flexible in size (I guess with a percentage
  or whatever).
  right now there is no way to guarantee that you will always see the text
  to the right of the image. resize window or font, and it might show up under
  it even if there's plenty of room to the right.

### search results


### display

- if we can find icons, show the region icon?
- same for sets
- show the sort arrow in a different color
  - we could create a new component SortArrow for this, or something
  - in fact, the table headers could also be their own component... but no rush :)
- some effects have no name (e.g. Zyavu); in that case, don't show the "-" after
  "Effect" in the card details.
- when we start, set focus to name field?
- minor: web app still has React favicon, maybe we should replace this?
- card details: the cost of powers (a number) can be displayed more like it's
  done on the card, by using appropriate CSS

### misc

- when sorting by region, do we put the multi-regions together? or do we just
  sort by the first region and then by original order (i.e. card name)?
  - problem is, if you do a reverse sort, the names are *also* sorted in reverse.

- flavor text often contains newlines, which should really be rendered as
  <br>s in HTML.
  - maybe look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23616226/insert-html-with-react-variable-statements-jsx
  - also quotes need to be kept!

- in the list of starting cards, we could make the cards clickable links,
  that open the card in question?
  - what do we do if the current filters don't show that card?
  - with the current settings, it would close the original card, which
    may be annoying.

- should we provide unique URLs for each card somehow?
  - what would they point to? separate page? or show the list with that card open?

- some things we iterate over still need a 'key' attribute... at least the
  browser keeps showing annoying warnings for that... so I guess I have to add
  reasonable keys to the few ones left, even though they're useless. (e.g. when
  looping over effects/powers in card details... will probably have to add those
  to JSON, since I cannot create a reliable key from the data already there.
  no, name is not guaranteed to be unique.)

### cleanup/refactoring

- if CheckBox turns out to work well, use it everywhere

### README/instructions

- In the README, add a link to some site that explains what Magi-Nation is...
  perhaps several sites
- mention in "instructions" that MRP data comes from BlueFurok.com

### HTML/CSS

- instead of floating, we could use a flexbox for card image and details?
- (fancy :) in card details, the name of the card could have a slight drop
  shadow in the color of the region
