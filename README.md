# Magi-Nation Duel
###

Magi-Nation Duel (MND) was a collectible card game from the early 2000s.
It only lasted a few years, but there is still a community of fans
who love this little game.

There were also a Magi-Nagion Game Boy Color game, a Japanese Game Boy
Advance remake (somewhat disliked by MND fans), and children's TV show
(greatly disliked by MND fans).

More info on the game can be found on the community subreddit's wiki,
including a variety of compiled resources, where to find current
communities, how to play online, and where to purchase or trade cards
and memorabilia.
