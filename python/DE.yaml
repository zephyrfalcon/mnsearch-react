    The energy cost for this Geyser is zero if played by an Underneath
    Shadow Magi. In order to play this Geyser, you must discard six Core
    cards from your hand. Place this Geyser on the table.
    All non-Core Magi with an Underneath card in play draw one less card
    during their Draw Step. Draw one additional card during your Draw
    Step. You may not play another Underneath Shadow Geyser while this
    one is in play. If your Magi leaves play, you may keep all but one of
    your Shadow Geysers in play. Agram does not discard any Shadow
    Geysers from play when he leaves play.
